          a: "A domain, or domain name, is essentially a web URL or address. Simply put, your domain is the digital equivalent of a store's physical address, and is how your customers find and access your online business. A custom domain helps your brand look professional and builds trust."
        },
        {
          q: "What is a subdomain?",
          a: "If a domain name is the face of your virtual storefront, think of a subdomain as another door. It is an optional part of a domain name that appears as a prefix, placed before the root domain (such as shop.yourwebsite.com). You can easily connect and manage subdomains directly from your Matgarco admin."
        },
        {
          q: "How does buying a domain through Matgarco work?",
          a: "It's simple: Search for a name, choose an extension, and purchase it. Every domain is registered in your name and set up automatically to point to your store. SSL is issued automatically, and DNS is preconfigured. No technical headaches."
        },
        {
          q: "How much does a domain cost?",
          a: "Domain prices vary by extension (TLD) like .com or .store. With Matgarco, there are no hidden fees. The price includes domain registration, automatic renewal, and free WHOIS privacy protection to safeguard your personal information."
        },
        {
          q: "Do I need to purchase hosting?",
          a: "No! You do not need to purchase separate web hosting when you use Matgarco. All Matgarco plans come with secure, fast web hosting with unlimited bandwidth included for free."

        q: "What is Matgarco?",
        a: "Matgarco is an integrated e-commerce platform specifically designed for the Egyptian and Arab markets. We provide everything you need to launch your store in minutes using our AI assistant (Quantus AI), with ready integration for payment gateways and shipping companies, so you can sell immediately without coding experience.",
      },
      {
        q: "What makes Matgarco different from Shopify?",
        a: "Unlike Shopify, which bills you in USD, Matgarco offers fixed pricing in EGP. Most importantly, we provide direct integration with local payments (Paymob, Instapay, Vodafone Cash) and locally known shipping companies without the need for coding or expensive plugins.",
      },
      {
        q: "How much does the subscription cost? Are there setup fees?",
        a: "There are no setup fees. Our plans start from 250 EGP per month (Starter plan). All prices include VAT and there are no hidden fees. You can also start with a 14-day free trial without entering a credit card.",
      },
      {
        q: "Does the platform take a commission on sales?",
        a: "On the (Professional) and (Business) plans, you keep 100% of your profits with 0% commission. On the entry-level (Starter) plan, we apply a nominal fee of 2% per order to cover the costs of using the central account.",
      },
      {
        q: "How does the shipping and delivery system work?",
        a: "We provide the option to use Matgarco's central account for direct dealing with major well-known shipping companies in one step, or you can link your own accounts (such as Bosta or Aramex) directly if you prefer.",
      },
      {
        q: "I currently sell on Facebook and Instagram, how do I move my products?",
        a: "We developed the (Social Bridge) feature specifically for you. You can import all your products, with their images and details, directly from your social media accounts to your new store with a single click.",
      },
      {
        q: "Can I link a custom domain to my store?",
        a: "Yes, on advanced plans you can link your own domain (e.g., www.yourbrand.com). On all plans, you will by default receive a free and secure subdomain from Matgarco.",
      },
      {
        q: "Is there a mobile app for store management?",
        a: "Yes, we provide a control panel that works with Progressive Web App (PWA) technology. This means you can manage your entire store from your mobile browser seamlessly with an experience similar to native apps, without the need to download an app from stores.",
      },
      {
        q: "Can I change my plan or cancel the subscription?",
        a: "Certainly. You can upgrade or downgrade your plan at any time from the control panel. If you decide the platform doesn't suit you, you can simply cancel the subscription without any obligations.",
